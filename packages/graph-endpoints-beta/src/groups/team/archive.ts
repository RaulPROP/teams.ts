/**
  * `POST /groups/{group-id}/team/archive`
  *
  * Archive the specified team. 
When a team is archived, users can no longer make most changes to the team. For example, users can no longer: send or like messages on any channel in the team; edit the team&#x27;s name or description; nor edit other settings. However, membership changes to the team continue to be allowed. Archiving is an async operation. A team is archived once the async operation completes successfully, which can occur subsequent to a response from this API. To archive a team, the team and group must have an owner. To restore a team from its archived state, use the API to unarchive.
